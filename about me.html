    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">Hello my name is Dean. I have been drawing since I could remember.&nbsp;<br>
      My inspiration has been Takato Yamamoto (I have a piece tattooed on me) and many online artists that I have followed throughout the years. I have been taking all available art classes since highschool, I have picked up many mediums from hands on to digital work. My life without drawing is consisant of playing video games and reading manga or novels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">My favorite media is digital, I use my Ipad for my tool. Although I would say my best work has been painting. Digital is more convient and on the go while traditional seems a lot to tackle on, my kitchen would be a mess every project when I was taking my Elements of Design class!&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">&nbsp;I have touched on character design by making my DnD character into a full fleshed out character with a background and timeline. I also made a partner for him named Amon, making sure he had as complex background as the first character.</p>
    <p class="text_column aboutmetext">My biggest passion in making life is to create. It doesn't necessarily mean only art. Humans create memories, love, and lives. Everyone is an artist one way or another and I truly believe&nbsp; that from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
